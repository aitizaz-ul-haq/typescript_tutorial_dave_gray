typescript is a strongly typed langaguge that means we need to describr types unlike javascript
where we dont have to define the types becuse in typesscript the types are dfefined
on compile time while in javascipt the types are defined on run time when code is executed 

so when we say that we have to define the types that nessecaryly does not mean that 
we have to write the types we cannot write the types typescript would still know the type
when refrenced to a value for example if we have avariable and assign a string value to it typescript would know 
that the type of this variable is string but here is when typescripts strict type 
comes into play is when we use a string for a number operation or even assign it a num,ber value it will give error so 
meaning strit type does not just mean defining the type of a variable or whatever but also 
the usage also becomes restriceted

when type is any this will defeast typescript because any can be any thing

with functions it is important to define the type of parameters no matter how many they are

there is a union type that allows to create a union of two types so if we want a variable
to have two different types we can create a union of the two types this will
make a union of the two types in it
