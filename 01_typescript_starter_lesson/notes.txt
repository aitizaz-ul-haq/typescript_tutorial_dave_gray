TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
because typescript is a developers tool

typescript is a super set of JavaScript
typescript is from microsoft

before starting we need to add typescript to project yarn and or npm
typescript files have extension ts 

typescript compiles to javascript to compile a ts file to javascript
we use tsc to do that and then run js file this is how typescript
files are compileed and run

now we have to every time run tsc command to compile the ts file
instead we can use -w to watch a ts file whenever there are changes they will
be automatically added

but every time we compile a ts file it will create a js file and we want 
to store our ts files in a saperate folder so we crteate a build folder 
this is the code that is compiled code and we can store all of our js 
html and css files in our build folder and ts files in ts folder

but to do that we are going to tell our typescript where to put our 
compiled js files offcourse we are going to need to config our typescripe
what we can do is run tsc init which will give use config file to config
typescript

so it will create a tsconfig file that already contains
commented out ts configurations now what we can do is provide a root 
directory to ts so it knows where all the ts files are

so we would also tell it the out directory where compilesd files would be located

now for typescript to watch for all files just like we applied -w watch 
for one file we will set it for entire directory by typing tsc -w 
command in the terminal

now that we have added ts config file we can see in its target
config that the js version being used is es2016 so let will now be used instead of 
var

if you remove a file from your ts file you also have to remove it from your js file

so what if we make ats file in root directory other than src it will create a js file 
rigth there this is not what we want from it so what we do is we add include 
src in our ts config file this will allow ts file to include that root file 
also in our js folder

if we dont give type in typescript that will still be valid javascript so the code will compile and run
but typescript does not like this and will show a swingly error line typescript does not get tin the way of javascript and still compile

typescript will compile js no matter how many errors there are with regards to typescript but off course we
dont want that so to stop us when ever we make a mistake in ts to stop ts from amaking a js file 
we can set a setting in tsconfig file by setting noEmitOnError value to true
this will not allow ts file to compile a js file untill errors are removed
